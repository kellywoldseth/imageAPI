New skills practiced/demonstrated: Node.js, typescript, Jasmine for testing, Express

Challenges/Things I learned:
-I did not know to mak ea .eslintrc.json file since the lessons had that file pre-created for us (and hidden from us). I now know that it is needed to run the linter and how to create it.
-I did not know how to test servers/routes when starting this project since we learned how to build them after the testing lesson, so I was able to research and teach myself that.
-I did not know how to export an image to a server and was able to research the .sendFile method
-The folder structure heirarchy was a little confusing at first but my notes from the lessons helped a lot.
-I didn't practice TDD and write my tests before because at the beginning, I had no idea what the project was going to look like or what I would even want to test. If I were to do a similar project in the future, I feel more comfortable now writing the tests ahead of time and I understand the idea of Test Driven Development.

Successes:
-Typescript came really easy to me since I am most comfortable in Java.
-Prettier was very easy to install and very helpful to use.
-Nodemon was very helpful in saving time every time to reboot my server I made a change.
-I taught myself git/version control and was able to use it with ease.
-I created an index.html just for fun and to make the project look nicer. This took almost no time at all since I'm very comfortable with html and css.



Questions I have for my project reviewer:
-where is the best place to keep the assests/thumbs folders?
